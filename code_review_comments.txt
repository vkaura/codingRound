Code Review Comments

1. Created relevant package names for the test classes, pages and utils as supposed to the default package.

2. Added a testng.xml and configured the test classes for the same in order to run the tests as a single suite and               configured the same in the pom.xml as the default suite file in order to execute the tests as a part of the maven build.

3. Added Util.java:w class to hold the methods setDriverPath() and waitFor() that are being called at different times during the test execution.

4. SignInTest.java - Fixed the test failure by adding code to switch the frame after the Sign In click and added appropriate waits in order for a seamless test execution.

5. FlightBookingTest.java - Fixed the test failure by correcting the element from "toTag" to "ToTag" and added appropriate waits in order for a seamless test execution.

6. HotelBookingPage.java - Added a class for the HotelBookingTest holding the different WebElements using the @FindBy annotation for the Page object model with appropriate getter methods, used to test the scenario of hotel search.

7. HotelBookingTest.java - Fixed the test failure by utilizing the WebElements (check-in date, check-out date etc.) from the HotelBookingPage and added an assert to verify the search summary

8. To run the tests, navigate to the path to the codingRound on the local and execute: mvn clean install
